const express = require("express"); // import express

const app = express(); // call the express package, you can name anything instead of "app", but we do it for best practices

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("Server running on port: 3000");
  //callback fn: it is nameless
  //because it is not being used anywhere except for this app.listen() only,
  //therefore, it doesn't require a name to be reused later
}); // express listens to port 3000(available by default in the system) where the request will be coming from
